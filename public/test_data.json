        "poem": "You say that father write a lot of books, but what he writes I don't\r\nunderstand.\r\nHe was reading to you all evening, but could you really\r\nmake out what he meant?\r\nWhat nice stores, mother, you can tell us! Why can't father\r\nwrite like that, I wonder?\r\nDid he never hear from his own mother stories of giants and\r\nfairies and princesses?\r\nHas he forgotten them all?\r\nOften when he gets late for his bath you have to call him\r\na hundred times.\r\nYou wait and keep his dishes warm for him, but he goes on\r\nwriting and forgets.\r\nFather always plays at making books.\r\nIf ever I go to play in father's room, you come and call me,\r\n\"What a naughty child!\"\r\nIf I make the slightest noise you say, \"Don't you see that\r\nfather's at his work?\"\r\nWhat's the fun of always writing and writing?\r\nWhen I take up father's pen or pencil and write upon his book\r\njust as he does,-a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,-why do you get cross with me\r\nthen, mother?\r\nYou never say a word when father writes.\r\nWhen my father wastes such heaps of paper, mother, you don't\r\nseem to mind at all.\r\nBut if I take only one sheet to make a boat with, you say,\r\n\"Child, how troublesome you are!\"\r\nWhat do you think of father's spoiling sheets and sheets of\r\npaper with black marks all over both sides?"

        "poem": "If baby only wanted to, he could fly up to heaven this moment.\r\nIt is not for nothing that he does not leave us.\r\nHe loves to rest his head on mother's bosom, and cannot ever\r\nbear to lose sight of her.\r\nBaby know all manner of wise words, though few on earth can\r\nunderstand their meaning.\r\nIt is not for nothing that he never wants to speak.\r\nThe one thing he wants is to learn mother's words from\r\nmother's lips. That is why he looks so innocent.\r\nBaby had a heap of gold and pearls, yet he came like a beggar\r\non to this earth.\r\nIt is not for nothing he came in such a disguise.\r\nThis dear little naked mendicant pretends to be utterly\r\nhelpless, so that he may beg for mother's wealth of love.\r\nBaby was so free from every tie in the land of the tiny\r\ncrescent moon.\r\nIt was not for nothing he gave up his freedom.\r\nHe knows that there is room for endless joy in mother's little\r\ncorner of a heart, and it is sweeter far than liberty to be caught\r\nand pressed in her dear arms.\r\nBaby never knew how to cry. He dwelt in the land of perfect\r\nbliss.\r\nIt is not for nothing he has chosen to shed tears.\r\nThough with the smile of his dear face he draws mother's\r\nyearning heart to him, yet his little cries over tiny troubles\r\nweave the double bond of pity and love."

        "poem": "I wish I could take a quiet corner in the heart of my baby's very\r\nown world.\r\nI know it has stars that talk to him, and a sky that stoops\r\ndown to his face to amuse him with its silly clouds and rainbows.\r\nThose who make believe to be dumb, and look as if they never\r\ncould move, come creeping to his window with their stories and with\r\ntrays crowded with bright toys.\r\nI wish I could travel by the road that crosses baby's mind,\r\nand out beyond all bounds;\r\nWhere messengers run errands for no cause between the kingdoms\r\nof kings of no history;\r\nWhere Reason makes kites of her laws and flies them, the Truth\r\nsets Fact free from its fetters."
